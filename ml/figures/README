** These figures are for charges_esp.csv and pairwise_distance_v2.csv data files for each mimichrome.

data_split_type_1 : 

We split each trajectory into a train/test (80/20) split or train/val/test (60/20/20) split.
We maintain order of the frames in a trajectory such that the first few are train, the next few are val (if used) and the last few are test.
We then stitch together the corresponding splits from all 8 trajectories.

data_split_type_2: 

We split the ordered frames (3200) into a train/test (87.5/12.5) split or train/val/test (75/12.5/12.5) split.
We maintain order of the frames such that the first few are train, the next few are val (if used) and the last few are test.
This implies the trajectories are split into 7/1 for train/test or 6/1/1 for train/val/test.
